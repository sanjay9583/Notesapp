The French simple future tense (futur simple) is used to express actions that will occur in the future. It is formed by two parts:

1. The future stem of the verb (the infinitive form without -er, -ir, -re)

2. The appropriate ending (-ai, -as, -a, -ons, -ez, -ont)

For -er verbs, the endings are:

- je parler**ai** - I will speak
- tu parler**as** - you will speak 
- il/elle/on parler**a** - he/she/it will speak
- nous parler**ons** - we will speak
- vous parler**ez** - you (pl) will speak
- ils/elles parler**ont** - they will speak

For -ir and -re verbs, the endings are:

- je finir**ai** - I will finish
- tu finir**as** - you will finish
- il/elle/on finir**a** - he/she/it will finish 
- nous finir**ons** - we will finish
- vous finir**ez** - you (pl) will finish  
- ils/elles finir**ont** - they will finish

Some examples:

- Nous voyager**ons** en France l'année prochaine. - We will travel to France next year. 
- Ils acheter**ont** une nouvelle voiture. - They will buy a new car.
- Tu réussir**as** à l'examen. - You will succeed on the exam.

The simple future is often used to make predictions about the future or talk about plans. It is a simple and common way to talk about the future in French.

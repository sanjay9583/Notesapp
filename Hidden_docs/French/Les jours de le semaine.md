# Les Jours de la Semaine (The Days of the Week)

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn the French names for the 7 days of the week and some key information related to the days in French-speaking contexts. Knowing the days of the week is essential for talking about your schedule, making plans, and going about daily life in French.

The days in French are:

| English | French | Pronunciation |
|-|-|-|  
| Monday | lundi | luhn-dee |
| Tuesday | mardi | mahr-dee |
| Wednesday | mercredi | mehrk-ruh-dee |
| Thursday | jeudi | zhuh-dee |
| Friday | vendredi | vahn-druh-dee |
| Saturday | samedi | sahm-dee |
| Sunday | dimanche | dee-mahnsh |


It's important to note that in French, the days of the week are not capitalized like they are in English. 

??? Example
    - Je vais au cinéma **dimanche**. (I'm going to the movies on **Sunday**.)
    - Tu as un rendez-vous **mardi**? (Do you have an appointment on **Tuesday**?)
    - Je vais à la plage **samedi**. (I'm going to the beach on **Saturday**.)
    - Je vais à l'école **lundi**. (I'm going to school on **Monday**.)
    - Je vais au parc **mercredi**. (I'm going to the park on **Wednesday**.)
    - Je vais au restaurant **vendredi**. (I'm going to the restaurant on **Friday**.)
    - Je vais au supermarché **jeudi**. (I'm going to the supermarket on **Thursday**.)

## Common Mistakes

Some common mistakes students make with the days of the week in French:

- Forgetting they are not capitalized.
- Mixing up mercredi and jeudi. Remember mercredi comes first.
- Mispronouncing samedi and dimanche. The final "i" makes the preceding "a" nasalized.  
- Getting vendredi and jeudi mixed up since "Fri"day and "Thurs"day sound similar in English.

## Q&A

??? Question 
    Can you review the gender of the days of the week again?
    ??? Response
        **Réponse:** In French, the days of the week are all masculine, so you would use the masculine article **"le"** before them. For example: 

        - **le** lundi 
        - **le** mardi
        - **le** mercredi
        - etc.

        The one exception is **dimanche** which can sometimes be feminine, in which case you'd say **"la"** dimanche. But most often, **dimanche** is masculine too.
??? Question 
     What does Mardi Gras mean and how is it celebrated?
    ??? Response

        **Réponse:** Mardi Gras means "Fat Tuesday" in French. It refers to the day of celebration and feasting before the period of fasting for Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. Mardi Gras is celebrated in many traditionally Catholic regions with parades, masks, music, and food before the more sober 40 days of Lent. The most famous Mardi Gras celebrations are in New Orleans and Rio de Janeiro.

??? Question 
    Is Wednesday always a half-day for French students? 
    ??? Response
        **Réponse:** No, having Wednesday as a half-day is not a nationwide policy, but it is common in many French schools, especially primary schools, to have class end at noon on Wednesdays. However, some schools may have normal hours on Wednesday or only certain grade levels are affected. So the Wednesday half-day schedule varies between schools and regions. But it is a widely practiced tradition to give students a bit of a break in the middle of the week.
